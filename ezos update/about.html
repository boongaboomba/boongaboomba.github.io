          About the owners of Ezo’s Sushi Bar & Kitchen

          The partners have developed a vision together: a restaurant that showcases excellent Japanese sushi and introduces Vietnamese and Thai dishes to their suburban Long Island community, which currently has limited Asian dining options beyond Chinese takeout and hibachi chains. Michael brings deep knowledge of Japanese cuisine and cultural context, while Daniel contributes his training in Vietnamese and Thai cooking. Both are invested in doing this respectfully and authentically.

        “Ezo Sushi Bar & Kitchen feels like peace in motion. The minimalist design and calm atmosphere create this almost meditative dining experience. The sushi’s balance between texture and temperature is beautifully precise. I’d only suggest adding a few vegan-friendly options so more people can experience that serenity.”

The place clean, the folks polite, and the food? Lawd have mercy. Only thing I’d say is y’all need to add some sweet tea on that menu—don’t play with me now!”

        “Ezo Sushi Bar & Kitchen honors tradition with grace. Each dish shows respect for balance, discipline, and flavor. The knife work is impeccable—sharp, precise, like a silent art form. The atmosphere reminds me of home, yet the creativity makes it modern. My only suggestion: offer a chef’s omakase experience to showcase true mastery.”
