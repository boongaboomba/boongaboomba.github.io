  <br>
  <p>
    This website is a visual collection of ten iconic Air Jordan sneakers,
    showcasing their release years, designs, and cultural impact.
    Each sneaker has its own page with a short explanation and a centered layout
    for easy viewing.
    <br>
    (Only because I didn't want to do all of the Jordans and I think 10 was enough)
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    This project was created for my class assignment to demonstrate the use of
    how far I've gotten when coding my HTML, CSS, and learning newer codes outside
    of class which was added to my project website.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for viewing the collection.
